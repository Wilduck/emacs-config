;; init.el is my entry point for emacs customization. This file should
;; be used exclusively for setting up the load path, handling
;; packages, and requiring other files that contain the actual
;; customizations that I'm including.
;;
;; The customizations are further organized into the following files,
;; all within `site-lisp`:
;;
;;     - customize.el   = customizations to the base system
;;     - defuns.el      = functions that I've written
;;     - keybindings.el = Global and mode specific keybindings
;;     - mode-mappings  = map filenames to major modes
;;     - hooks          = load elisp on major mode loading
